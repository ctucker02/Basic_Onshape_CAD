# Basic_Onshape_CAD
A repository for all of my basic OnShape assignments. 
## Caster Base
First assignment on Onshape was to create the base to a wheel caster by making a rectangle, extruding it, and cutting 7 holes in it using linear pattern and other new features.

## Caster Mount
Second assignment on Onshape was to create the Mount to a wheel caster by making a square, extruding it, and cutting 4 holes in each corner of the square and a middle hole for the fork.

## Caster Fork
The third onshape assignment was to create a circle and extrude it, then make two fork-like structures on one side and a cylinder on the opposite side. This is what is going to hold the wheel in place.
